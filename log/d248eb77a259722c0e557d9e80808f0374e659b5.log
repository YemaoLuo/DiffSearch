InternalNioInputBuffer.java
Add additional state in HTTP Nio connector non-blocking HTTP headers parsing
as a self-guard against unexpected call to parseHeaders() after the parsing has already been completed
without a prior call to recycle() or nextRequest().
One such occurrence was observed because of a bug that did not recycle the buffer and was fixed a while ago.

The request will be rejected with error 400. The message is visible only with debug logging in AbstractHttp11Processor.
