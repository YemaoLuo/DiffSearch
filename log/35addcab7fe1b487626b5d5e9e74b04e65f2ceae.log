Make the calls to remove/reload the SSLHostConfig case insensitive

The is the fifth and final part of the fix to make mapping of SNI values

While not strictly related to SNI processing, a review of all of the
uses of sslHostConfigs identified these additional locations where the
host name may be provided in mixed case.
