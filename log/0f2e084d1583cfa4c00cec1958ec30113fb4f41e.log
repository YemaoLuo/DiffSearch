Fix BZ 65454. Correct a timing issue that could delay a request

If the work queue is not empty, it is likely that a task was added to
the work queue between this thread timing out and the worker count being
decremented a few lines above this comment. In this case, create a
replacement worker so that the task isn't held in the queue waiting for
one of the other workers to finish.
