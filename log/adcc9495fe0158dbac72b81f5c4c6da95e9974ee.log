Remove unnecessary code

Node.ELExpression instances are not created if pageInfo.isELIgnored is
true. It seems likely this code predates the refactoring (many years
ago) that switched to parsing in two passes. The first pass parses just
the directives. The second parses everything given on the basis of the
directives found in the first pass.
