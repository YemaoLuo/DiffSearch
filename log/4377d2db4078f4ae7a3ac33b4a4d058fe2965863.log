Simplify non blocking write

Non blocking read uses a straight read, and I couldn't see why write
wouldn't be able to do the same thing, the called code is 100%
equivalent once block is false: it doesn't do anything except call the
channel write.
Note: if it works fine, it should be possible to remove the block flag
in NioSelectorPool as it is now unused (it is always true when it is
called).
