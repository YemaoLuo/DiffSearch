Remove unnecessary code

If an attribute is not a named attribute then it must appear in an XML
element in the form attributeName="attributeValue". There is no way to
construct such an XML attribute such that the attributeValue is null. I
have also checked all the possible code paths to this method and I could
not find any where an attribute that was not a named attribute could
have a null value.
