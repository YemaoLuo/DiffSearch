Ensure that stack traces are fully indented. The entire stack trace is
now indented by an additional TAB rather than just the first line being
indented by a space which meant 'Caused by:..." lines and similar were
not indented. This facilitates the skipping of stack traces as described
in the class's Javadoc.
