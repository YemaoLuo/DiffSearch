==================================================
Drop use of a complex recycling structure which saved allocation of a very simple object at the likely cost of significant syncing. Will revert if it is believed it actually had some sort of beneficial impact (given my experience with the NIO2 connector which doesn't use the object caches by default, I would say no).
