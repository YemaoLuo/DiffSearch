Remove the ResourceBundle memory leak protection since I am as sure as I can be that the original report was a false positive. The reasons I think this are:
- The GC roots related to ResourceBundle were all weak references.
- I can no longer produce the leak with the same (newer version) test application and Java the original 1.8. If it was a GC bug it is fixed in any version of Java that Tomcat 9 will use.
- We have a better understanding of JVM bugs that make some GC roots not visible in profilers like YourKit.
