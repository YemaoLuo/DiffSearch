- Port changes from the NIO connector to the APR connector, to resolve memory leaking when using an executor (note:
  when not using an executor, no memory leak could occur).
- Discard thread local usage altogether, as my testing did not show a measurable performance difference. I don't know
  if this would change when scaling up the number of CPUs (if anyone wants to test).
- No size limit by default, since this is mechanically limited (amount of threads + open comet connections).
- Harmonize code with the HTTP/1.1 connector.
