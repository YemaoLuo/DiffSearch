Remove unneeded line from the method that normalizes decodedURI.

The line "uriBC.setBytes(b, start, end);" is wrong, as it should have been "uriBC.setBytes(b, start, end - start);". I suppose that it worked because in the only place that calls this normalize() method the value of 'start' was always equal to zero.

Instead of fixing, I am removing that line, because it actually is not needed there at all, thanks to the uriBC.setEnd() calls above it.
