Add sync when processing asynchronous operation in NIO

The NIO poller seems to create some unwanted concurrency, causing rare
CI test failures that for whatever reason did not show up before 9.0.20.
#4293 and #4297 show thread safety related buffer corruption which as
far as I can tell can only occur through the poller. It doesn't seem
right to me that there is concurrency here, but it's not hard to add a
sync.
