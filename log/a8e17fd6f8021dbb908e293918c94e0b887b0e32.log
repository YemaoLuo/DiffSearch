Matcher.java
Review of fix for https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56801
Revert public API changes from r1615876

I think match(String, char[], boolean) is a bad signature to expose such method as public.

My concerns:
a) Maybe there is a way to cache String->char[] conversions for the pattern set as well.
In that case the method signature will become (char[],char[],..).
As of now the current improvement is an incomplete one.

b) I am not sure that using String vs char[] array has much difference.
Is it worth to stick to char[] in the API?
