Fix intermittently failing test.

If you fake a blocking with async write while processing a read there is
a strong chance of a deadlock. The read will be holding a lock on the
SocketWrapper. If the async write does not complete in-line it will
perform a dispatch when it is ready to write and that dispatch will try
to obtain a lock on the socket wrapper. The lock on that opbject is
already held and a deadlock will follow.
