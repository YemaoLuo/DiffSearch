ELParser.java
Second attempt at fixing
https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56029
This fixes BZ56029 by storing any whitespace before a token with the
token and then including it when the expression is re-created.
It also fixes an issue with the function parsing that meant that ternary
expressions could be corrupted if two tokens were parsed before the mark
was reset.
