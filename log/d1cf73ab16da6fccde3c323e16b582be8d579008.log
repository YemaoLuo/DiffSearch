BeanFactory.java
Enhance our naming BeanFactory.

If a bean property exists which the Introspector
presents us with a type that we don't have a
string conversion for, but the bean actually
has a method to set the property from a string,
allow to provide this information to the
BeanFactory.

New attribute "forceString" taking a comma separated
list of items as values. Each item is either a bean
property name (e.g. "foo") meaning that there is a
setter function "setFoo(String)" for that property.
Or the item is of the form "foo=method" meaning that
property "foo" can be set by calling "method(String)".

This should make writing a custom bean factory
obsolete in quite a few cases.

Concrete use case was tibco TibjmsConnectionFactory
which has an attribute SSLIdentity detected by
Introspector as byte[] but which can be set by
setSSLIdentity(String). Existing BeanFactory throws
NamingException.
