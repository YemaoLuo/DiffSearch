UpgradeServletInputStream.java
- Add debugging of my own (sorry), on socket close.
- Try dropping the direct socket close from the upgraded streams (the sockets seem to still be closed and the ws tests pass with NIO1+2). Actually following the discussions on the EG, I don't think the close required logic is fully right, it would seem it should wait for both input AND output to be closed, but this needs to be validated.
