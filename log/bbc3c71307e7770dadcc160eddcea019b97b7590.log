- Initially after accept, do regular processing rather than awaitBytes, since awaitBytes is not as light as it used to be and the bytes could be there. Maybe it could be configurable.

- Initially after accept, do regular processing rather than awaitBytes, since awaitBytes is not as light as it used to be and the bytes could be there. Maybe it could be configurable.
- Don't always fork a new thread after awaitBytes. If it didn't complete inline then it is supposed to be useless.
- This however caused problems with write notifications. Although I do understand the changes that were made, a notification should not be recursive, so use a new thread in that case.
