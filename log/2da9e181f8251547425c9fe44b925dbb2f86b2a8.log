DataSourceUserDatabaseTests.java
Add first pass at tests for the DataSource UserDatabase

Use a shortcut to allow independent testing without a real DataSource.
Test both the DataSourceRealm schema as well as the full schema with
groups.
Only glitch is that Derby leaves a derby.log, I haven't found how to
configure it away.
