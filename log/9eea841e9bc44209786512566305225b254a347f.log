TestSerializablePrincipal.java
Properly delete %TEMP%/ser{number}.tmp temporary file that was used to test serialization of a Principal.

On Windows the test could not delete the file, because FileInputStream has not been properly closed after reading. Thus rerunning the testsuite left a bunch of such files in the %TEMP% directory.

The file is now created in output/tmp instead of the system temporary directory.
