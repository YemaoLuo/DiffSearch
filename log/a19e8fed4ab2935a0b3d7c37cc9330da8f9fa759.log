Tolerate concurrency

The read call may return not_done by checking a semaphore, which allows
safe concurrent use of the API. However, if the buffers of a pending
read are concurrently cleared, then this may cause an underflow error
and this is discarding one of the API benefits. This seems to be a very
rare scenario. Adding some checks and sync would be expensive so this
might not be a win. Will have to verify performance however ...
