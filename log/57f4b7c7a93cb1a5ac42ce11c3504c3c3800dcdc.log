StandardContext.java
Refactor and address some TODOs.
Should be no functional change.
Make code easier to follow and more obviously aligned to the specification.
Removing the to be overwritten patterns will result in all collections for the constraint being empty which will trigger the removal of the constraint (which is what the old code did more directly). The old code just looked as if it might be removing too much.
