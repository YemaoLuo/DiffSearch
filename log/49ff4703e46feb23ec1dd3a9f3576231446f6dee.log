Http2AsyncParser.java
Sync to avoid apparent HTTP/2 state problems

Using the HTTP/2 demo page (the one with 100s of tomcat.gif that was
used at ApacheCons in the past), I could see some errors caused by the
state check line 1530 in Http2UpgradeHandler, the state being CLOSED_RX
(so no window updating).
