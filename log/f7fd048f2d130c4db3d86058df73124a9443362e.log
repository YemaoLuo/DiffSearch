OpenSSLContext.java
Correct regression in refactoring that broke TLS with a single cert

When a single certificate is used the type is likely to be undefined.
That caused the lookup of the storage slot to return an incorrect value.
In this case just use the RSA slot as it is only convention that maps a
given slot to a specific type. Tomcat Native and OpenSSL don't actually
care.
