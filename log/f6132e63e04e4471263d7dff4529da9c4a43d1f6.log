==================================================
Fix issue observed with APR, WebSocket and blocking messages. If one client freezes the system freezes once the network buffers are full. When the client unfroze, the backlog of traffic was cleared and then one or more connections were closed unexpectedly. This was caused by incorrectly setting a very short timeout when readding the socket to the Poller after only a subset of the registered events triggered.
