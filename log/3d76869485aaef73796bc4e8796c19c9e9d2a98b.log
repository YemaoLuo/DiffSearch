TestGroupChannelMemberArrival.java
Improve TestGroupChannelMemberArrival
1. Add synchronization when accessing TestMbrListener.members.
This should fix the failures observed by Gump.
2. Remove unused method #clear().
3. Improve messages printed to System.out during the test:
- Add timestamps
- Add hash code of threads (because thread names are not unique: They all are either "Membership-MemberAdded." or "Membership-MemberDisappeared.").
- Add current length of members list
4. Print messages when memberAdded()/memberDisappeared() performed no work.
That is if notification arrives twice for the same Member. I have not observed such events when running the tests.
