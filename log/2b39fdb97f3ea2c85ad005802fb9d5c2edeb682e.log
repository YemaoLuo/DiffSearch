Relax the requirement that the socket has to be in waiting requests. (HTTP/2 needs this).
Remove it if it is there but always process.
If the socket is closed SocketProcessor.run will exit early.
This test may have been aimed at working around multiple registrations but those issues should have been fixed at source now.
