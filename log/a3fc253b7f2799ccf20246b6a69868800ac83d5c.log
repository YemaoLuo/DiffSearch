SecureNio2Channel.java
Investigating 57799 I found some issues in the SSL impl:
- Possibly incomplete writes.
- After some errors (which shouldn't happen however), the pending flag could still be set.
- A bad idea to deal with possible behavior differences for read IO calls between NIO and NIO2 (according to my testing, it doesn't seem to be needed). Test: the byte counter.
