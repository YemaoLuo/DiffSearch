Change license header in two tomcat-lite java source files
using the copy2license.pl script.

Although the previous form is what the license file states how to
correctly apply ASL 2.0, usually the ASF copyright notice is not
applied to every source file. See

   http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html#headers

for details.
