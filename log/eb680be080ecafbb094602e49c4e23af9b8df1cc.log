OpenSSLEngine.java
Use an implicit scope

This ties the native memory to the Java GC in a very clean way. However,
I have to give up on bound method handles (this created a GC root) and
replace it with a static state map.
Also the MemorySegment that I was supposed to use creates another (very
weird, this one) GC root to the scope, so revert to MemoryAddress for
now.
