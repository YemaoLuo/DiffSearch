Preparation for fixing BZ 66120

https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=66120

Once BZ 66120 is fixed, the session note that holds the current session
ID during FORM authentication will be replicated across the cluster. If
failover occurs during FORM authentication, this note also needs to be
updated.

This change is a NO-OP until the fix for BZ 66120 is committed.
