Fix BZ 66541 - Improve handling of URLs for cached resources

Improve handling for cached resources for resources that use custom URL
schemes. The scheme specific equals() and hashcode() algorithms, if
present, will now be used for URLs for these resources. This addresses a
potential performance issue with some OSGi custom URL schemes that can
trigger potentially slow DNS lookups in some configurations.
