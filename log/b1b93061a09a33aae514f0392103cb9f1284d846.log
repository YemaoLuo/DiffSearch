New exception intended to be used when a protocol error occurs (e.g. client sent bad data) and we need to close the connection but we can't throw an unchecked exception (e.g. HttpUpgradeHandler.init()).

ProtocolException.java
New exception intended to be used when a protocol error occurs (e.g. client sent bad data) and we need to close the connection but we can't throw an unchecked exception (e.g. HttpUpgradeHandler.init()).
Having a dedicated exception will allow this to be caught in the ConnectionHandler and silently (well logged at debug level) caught without filling the logs with exceptions every time a client does something wrong.
