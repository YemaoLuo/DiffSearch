Revert part of r1026157

Removing "throwa NamingException" from parseName() methods as was done in r1026157 changed their API,
so that derived classes won't be able to throw that exception anymore.

I do not know the full story behind these two parseName() methods, but if they were supposed be overwritten it seems likely that they may throw a NamingException.
