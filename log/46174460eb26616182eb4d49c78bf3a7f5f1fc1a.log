HostConfig.java
Small code improvements in HostConfig class:

1) In deployWAR() call digester.reset() first before doing non-trivial work such as "new URL(...)",
because digester is a shared instance. Though a failure in the "new URL()" call there is very unlikely.

2) Reduce scope of "JarEntry entry" variable, getting rid of "finally{entry=null;}" blocks.
Anyway a JarEntry is available only while the original JarFile is open.
