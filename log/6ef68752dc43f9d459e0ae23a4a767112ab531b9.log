WebappClassLoaderBase.java
Filter out classes streams through class file transformers

Make getResourceAsStream go through the ClassFileTransformer(s) for
.class resources. In a way this is consistent, but the actual reason is
helping JSP work better [JDT uses that to do its compilation] if
choosing a very basic runtime Jakarta conversion. I'm not seeing any
basis for doing it, but it's completely unlikely to break anything
either.
