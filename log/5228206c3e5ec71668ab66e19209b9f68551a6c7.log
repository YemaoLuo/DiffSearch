NonLoginAuthenticator.java
Refactor the non-login authenticator to align it with the other authenticators.
There is never any need to create a session and set a Principal for this authenticator. Either the user principal has been set before this authenticator is called (in which case no need to set the Principal in the session) or it can't be set by this authenticator (since it doesn't do authentication).
