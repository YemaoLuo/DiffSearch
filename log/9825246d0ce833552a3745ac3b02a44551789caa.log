AprEndpoint.java
Fix test failures caused by APR crash during shutdown

When a request thread was still trying to read/write from/to the socket,
the socket wrapper was not marked as closed so the thread tried to use
an APR socket that the POller then closed. Trying to read/write from a
closed APR socket will nearly always trigger a crash.
