Better fix for https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45403
With this patch, the allowLinking flag applies to all web application resources. It is very slightly slower. On my machine with allowLinking=false, the change to line 899 increases the time from ~7 microseconds to create the file to ~70 microseconds to create and validate the file. As far as I can tell, this change is only going to affect context start times. If directory listings are enabled in the default servlet, they will also be slightly slower but they were horribly slow to start with.
