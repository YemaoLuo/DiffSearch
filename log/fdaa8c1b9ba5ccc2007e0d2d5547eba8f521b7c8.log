Add async IO API to APR

This works from what I can see with the testsuite, but will remain
disabled by default forever. I'm adding it for consistency only, based
on the idea it would be easy to implement using the NIO code (it was,
mostly). The major problems with APR and the design this async API are
lack of IO vectoring (this could probably be added), and the need to use
direct buffers. This in turns forces extra flushes on output (maybe the
amount of flushes can be brought down), plus use of the main buffers
(which are direct). So the performance of APR ends up being worse than
NIO(2), while without async it is slightly faster.
