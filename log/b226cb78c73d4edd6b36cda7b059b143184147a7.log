DefaultInstanceManager.java
Save a bit of memory in annotations cache in DefaultInstanceManager
occupied by unused entries in annotation lists.

I could do the same by calling ArrayList.trimToSize(), preserving the Lists abstraction, but
1). That involves the same array copying operation as toArray() call that I am using,
2). I do not see any benefits from using List here, as the only operation with annotations
list after it has been created is iterating over it.

Thus I preferred to replace lists with explicit arrays.
