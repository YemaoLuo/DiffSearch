Call completion handler directly on timeout

Although it is possible I will redo it in a more precise way (but it is
harder) so that if an operation requires multiple IO operations it does
use decreasing timeouts, for now simply call the completion handler
directly on timeout to enforce the "global" operation timeout. The
actual IO will remain pending until it completes on its own, taking at
most the duration of the timeout in addition to the operation timeout.
