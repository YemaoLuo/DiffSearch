AjpAprProcessor.java
More non-blocking IO plumbing for the AJP APR/native connector.
This will allow reads to be non-blocking between messages (if desired) but remain blocking once a message starts. A more sophisticated approach to non-blocking could be taken but this approach is similar to how NIO does it and, depending on how mod_jk writes and reads data, may be all that is realistic.
