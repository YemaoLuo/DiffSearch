Nio2Endpoint.java
Avoid blocking write of internal buffer

This introduces some "useless" code, but this is to align with NIO and
APR code before moving code into SocketWrapperBase. There are a couple
of slightly risky changes (the async write of the write buffer, and
delaying setting the read/writeNotify flags until after getting the
semaphores) that could cause CI instability again (as usual the
testsuite passes for me ...).
