TldScanner.java
Fix missing implicit TLD map entries.

If TldResourcePath was already registred during parsing of jsp-config
section of web.xml, the implicit TLD map entries (derived from TLD files
URI) were not added to the uriTldResourcePathMap.

This was not in line with JSP2.2 specification section 7.3.4.
