- Add a vararg variant since it is probably nicer to use in a lot of cases (but keep the NIO2 variant as well since it is more flexible for array reuse).

Nio2Endpoint.java
- Add a vararg variant since it is probably nicer to use in a lot of cases (but keep the NIO2 variant as well since it is more flexible for array reuse).
- Add a block mode since it is trivial to do with the semaphore, it only adds an extra flag argument, and future user APIs might still have blocking IO.
