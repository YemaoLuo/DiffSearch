65991: Avoid NPE when checking for client cert

SSLAuthenticator would throw a NPE when boundOnInit was used on one of
the connectors since enabledProtocols is null until the connector is
started. Fall back on protocols when that happens (it is what is
configured, rather than what is actually used, so it's not as good).
