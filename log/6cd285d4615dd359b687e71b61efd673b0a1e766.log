CometConnectionManagerValve.java
- Add a connection tracking valve for Comet, which I did not test, but should implement the general concept.
- Next would be changing the Adapter.event to pass an int or an enum instead of the boolean to differentiate timeout,
  disconnect errors, etc. I will try to check handling of the timeout, and treat it like a periodic event, 
  where the servlet has the opportunity to close the connection (by calling event.close) but may choose 
  to keep the connection open event if there was no client activity (in which case, the connection will timeout 
  again after the usual amount of time).
