NioEndpoint.java
Avoid a blocking write of the internal buffer

When using this API, this IO block is extremely unlikely to occur, but
it still breaks the API contract, so fix it as NIO makes it rather easy.
With this fix the functionality now seems "final" to me.
Shuffle around code to make read and write identical, and remove common
code. I will now continue refactoring NIO2 and APR based on the template
to see if I can move some code to SocketWrapperBase.
