Remove 15s wait after each test.
I do not understand why that 15s wait with "inspect connections" message was there. Nothing was checked after the wait. Replaced it with a check of the count of received messages.
Removed wait after sending the last message in the group of 3.
This change saves (3 * 15 sec) + (1 sec + 2 sec) = 48 seconds.
