ChunkedOutputFilter.java
Simplify

In calculateChunkHeader() start pos at 8 rather than 7 and then
decrement before it is used rather than after. This results in the same
number of decrement calls and the same values used in chunkHeader.put()
but the returned value is 1 higher than previously, removing the need
for the +1 in the caller.
