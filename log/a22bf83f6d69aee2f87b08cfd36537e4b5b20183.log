SetCookieSupport.java
Apply patch 10 from jboynes to improve cookie handling.
Separate the code that determines whether a value should be quoted in Set-Cookie from the checks that are performed when parsing a Cookie header sent by a client.
I also did a small amount of clean up.
The patch should be safe since the logic is unchanged.
