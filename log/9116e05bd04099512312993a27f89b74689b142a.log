Change NIO poller thread count default to 1

I don't see the benefit of the weird default (which is basically always
2, and I don't understand why it is better than 1). Maybe it was useful
in the past. Given a socket is associated with a poller, if something
(somehow) goes wrong, then this would create a partially responsive
server which is not really better but makes problems harder to detect.
If I missed something, I am 100% ok to revert it (but I would be
interested in the performance study that says 2 is better than 1 here).
