Refactor tracking of serviced applications to use a concurrent Set

First in a series of patches aimed at allowing parallel requests to the
Manager application to deploy different applications in parallel rather
than using a sync block to deploy them serially.
Using a List was problematic as it allowed duplicates. This has been
addressed by switching to a Set.
Synchronized blocks have been replaced by using a concurrent Set.
A new method (tryAddServiced) has been added to the process of
checking if an app is being serviced, and registering it as such if
not, so that this can be performed atomically.
serviced has been retained in case it is used by custom sub-classes.
