Added in the skeleton for fairness logic, currently the tests for fairness are coming out extremely fair, could it  be that the Selector.selectedKeys() sorts the keys properly?

Added in the skeleton for fairness logic, currently the tests for fairness are coming out extremely fair, could it  be that the Selector.selectedKeys() sorts the keys properly?
Anyway, to implement a scheduler, I can use the "fairness" numbers added in here. Won't do it until I deem it necessary.
