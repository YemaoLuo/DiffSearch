HostConfig.java
Refactor HostConfig to track serviced apps consistently

Fourth in a series of patches aimed at allowing parallel requests to the
Manager application to deploy different applications in parallel rather
than using a sync block to deploy them serially.
Rather than just call isServiced() which only checks if another component
is working with the app at that point in time, call tryAddServiced which
also prevents other components from working with the app while the
deployer is working.
Review the code to ensure that there is only one call to tryAddServiced
on each code path that services an app (a second call would fail) and
that the necessary removeServiced calls are present in catch and/or
finally blocks as appropriate.
