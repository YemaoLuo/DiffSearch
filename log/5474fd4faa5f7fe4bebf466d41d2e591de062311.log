JspRuntimeLibrary.java
JSP compatibility testing for Graal

The JSP runtime library needed "equivalent" simpler reflection code to
work with Graal as java.beans.Introspector.getBeanInfo doesn't work for
me. This will likely lead to some limitations for JSPs.
Also add an Ant script to precompile JSPs and package them. The script
uses a dependency on target/tomcat-maven-1.0.jar which is cyclic, for
convenience (mvn package, precompile, mvn clean, mvn package again).
