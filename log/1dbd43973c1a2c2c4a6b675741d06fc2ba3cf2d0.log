SetPropertiesRule.java
Add end callback for set properties

When processing server.xml, there is no notification of the end of
configuration for objects. In some rare cases, it could be useful and
the next opportunity (Catalina lifecycle) comes way later. As a result,
add a trivial callback to address this and allow some processing on the
properties while still in the stage of processing server.xml.
