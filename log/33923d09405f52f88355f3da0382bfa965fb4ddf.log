DefaultInstanceManager.java
Prevent possible loss of cache entries due to GC by using strong rather
than weak references for the cache entries. This means removing the use
of Field and Method from the cache entry as they hold a strong reference
to Class which would break the cache since Class is the key for the
WeakHashMap that implements the cache.
