Avoid explicit key cancel on Java 11

NIO will internally do the work, so it's fine. The problem is abusive
internal syncing during that process, but some have been removed in Java
11 and this should be enough to avoid the deadlock described in the
stack trace of BZ64007. If still not resolved, then Java 14 removes even
more syncs during close.
