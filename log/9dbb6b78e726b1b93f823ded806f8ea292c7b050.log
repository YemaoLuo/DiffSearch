Investigating BZ 5926
An error page has to be able to call complete(). That means it needs to be able to call getAsycnContext() which means isStarted needs to be true for the ERROR state. That implies that isStarted needs to be true for the TIMING_OUT state as well.
This also implies that a transition form DISPATCHED to ERROR is not legal since that would mean moving from a state where isStarted==false to isStarted==true
