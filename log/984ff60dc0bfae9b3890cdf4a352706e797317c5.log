NamingManager.getObjectInstance does not work with Graal

For me it returns the reference in the native image, so obviously this
is not good. Resolve the reference using simple less flexible code. The
intermediate factory (that would use FactoryBase.getObjectInstance) must
be defined in the configuration manually because Graal doesn't trace it.
