Re-order for more predictable behaviour

Once the allocation requests are cancelled, other streams may start to
progress. This can result in errors being reported. Better to report the
error that triggered the closure before this so it is the first error
the client sees. A sequence of errors will then make more sense as it
will be clearer that the first error is the cause of the subsequent
errors.
