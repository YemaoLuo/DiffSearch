RpcChannel.java
Remove finalize call that can't do anything.

If Channel is not eligible for GC then it will retain a reference to
RpcChannel so finalize() will never be called.

If Channel is eligible for GC then it will be GC'd along with RpcChannel
and there will be no need to finalize to remove the reference from
Channel to RpcChannel.
