NioEndpoint.java
Fix a problem whereby if the poller was under low but consistent load (>1 request/per second and always less than 1s between requests) timeouts never took place.
After the change, timeouts will be processed every X seconds where pollerTimeout <= X <= (timoutInterval + pollerTimeout + time taken to process timeouts)
Note the default values for pollerTimeout and timeoutInterval are 1000ms
