Switch again to shared scope for the context

Following further feedback from Panama.
The problem is the implicit scope isn't explicitly closed on JVM
shutdown at the moment. OTOH, this change (once everything is done
properly, there were simply too many places when convenient references
could be kept, preventing GC) to a shared scope works fine both with GC
(like the implicit scope does) and JVM shutdown (the explicit clean call
on shutdown does the cleanup there).
The engine should be able to keep its implicit scope for optimal safety
(GC will likely come soon enough for engines).
