When adding a logger, its better to always add the parent loggers, all the way up the chain. 
The cost of this is relatively small, since the number of packages compared to classes is relatively small.
This feature allows extensions of the JULI framework to change log categories during run time, as opposed to changing them for every single logger in a category
