OpenSSLEngine.java
Refactor and simplify

As everything is synchronized, the segment can be allocated only once
(at the expense of adding memory use for the lifetime of the engine).
Note: no backport of this to Java 17 since using segments was causing
weird corruption for two of the methods (writeEncryptedData and
readEncryptedData; I never found an explanation for this but the direct
BB based code is working and can be avoided with configuration).
