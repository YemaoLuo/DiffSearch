ManagerServlet.java
Allow Manager app to deploy applications in parallel

Seventh and final patch in a series of patches aimed at allowing
parallel requests to the Manager application to deploy different
applications in parallel rather than using a sync block to deploy them
serially.
The previous refactoring of the list of serviced applications now means
that it is safe for the Manage application to deploy applications in
parallel.
