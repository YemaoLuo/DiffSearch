MUST_DISPATCH is not a state that requires non-container threads to be paused.
MUST_DISPATCH transitions to DISPATCHING in postProcess(). A call to complete() or dispatch() with the state in DISPATCHING triggers an IllegalStateException. The behaviour is the same if the state is MUST_DISPATCH. Therefore, there is no difference in end result whether the non-container thread is paused or not. Therefore, don't pause it so the ISE is triggered earlier rather than later.
