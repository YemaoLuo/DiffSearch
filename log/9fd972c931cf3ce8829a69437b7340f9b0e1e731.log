Only decode in standard mode.

The seamless decoding of both standard and URL-safe mode no longer works
as expected in some cases when one of the two characters from the other
mode appear in the encoded data. This is because rather than ignoring
the unexpected "-" or "_" it gets decoded and if the result is invalid
an exception is thrown due to the fix for CODEC-134.
Tomcat doesn't use URL-safe mode so simply disable it.
